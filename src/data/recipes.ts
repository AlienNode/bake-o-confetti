This recipe uses a mature sourdough starter to create a loaf with exceptional flavor, a crackling crust, and that distinctive open, chewy crumb. While it takes time, most of it is hands-off as the dough slowly ferments. The process is deeply satisfying, and the result is a bread that's leagues beyond anything you can buy at a supermarket.",
